## Plugin information (Partially superseded)
This plugin provides several tools to use images in machine learning applications. You can use a pre trained model to score images and obtain classes, or for feature extraction (obtaining the values taken by a layer for each image). You can also retrain a model to specialize it on a particular set of images, this process is known as transfer learning.

This plugin relies on the Keras library. Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python. We use it to run on top of the TensorFlow library as it enables fast experimentation with deep neural networks.

This plugin provides a total of 3 recipes, two macros and a webapp template.

⚠️ Starting with DSS version 11 this plugin is "partially superseded", we recommend using the native [image classification](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/machine-learning/computer-vision/index.html) capabilities.
